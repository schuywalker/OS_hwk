Questions

1. First, write a simple program called null.c that creates a pointer to an integer, sets it to NULL, and then tries to dereference it. Compile this into an executable called null. What happens when you run this program?
	compiles fine, but when run, output is:
	[1]    54703 segmentation fault  ./null
	I think this means that the address location is outside the bounds of the process (because in c, NULL means it's at a random address instead of "nothing").

2. Next,compile this program with symbol information included (with the -g flag). Doing so let’s put more information into the exe- cutable, enabling the debugger to access more useful information about variable names and the like. Run the program under the de- bugger by typing gdb null and then, once gdb is running, typing run. What does gdb show you?
	Aside from the abundance of warnings I get for using OSX, it shows us the pid: "Unable to find Mach task port for process-id 58076: (os/kern) failure (0x5)."

3. Finally,use the valgrind tool on this program. We’ll use the memcheck tool that is a part of valgrind to analyze what happens. Run
this by typing in the following: valgrind --leak-check=yes null. What happens when you run this? Can you interpret the output from the tool?


4. Write a simple program that allocates memory using malloc() but forgets to free it before exiting. What happens when this program runs? Can you use gdb to find any problems with it? How about valgrind (again with the --leak-check=yes flag)?


5. Write a program that creates an array of integers called data of size 100 using malloc; then, set data[100] to zero. What happens when you run this program? What happens when you run this program using valgrind? Is the program correct?


6. Create a program that allocates an array of integers (asabove),frees them, and then tries to print the value of one of the elements of the array. Does the program run? What happens when you use valgrind on it?


7. Now pass a funny value to free (e.g., a pointer in the middle of the array you allocated above). What happens? Do you need tools to find this type of problem?
